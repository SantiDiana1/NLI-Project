Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media,Master's,"The mission of the Master in Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media (CSIM) is to train the researchers and professionals who will investigate, develop and design the interactive cognitive systems and media of tomorrow. The results may be physical devices, such as robots, or logical ones, such as sophisticated software that provides new experiences and/or virtual environments.

The CSIM programme draws on three main fields of knowledge: interactive technology, cognitive sciences and interactive media. To achieve its objective, the programme takes an interdisciplinary approach that is critical to providing students with an in-depth knowledge of the design, construction, development, deployment and analysis of interactive cognitive systems and media, along with the necessary skills to successfully carry out all of these stages. The CSIM programme's goal is to produce integrators of such interactive cognitive devices and programmes."
Intelligent Interactive Systems,Master's,"Future emerging technologies will provide both interactivity and intelligence. The master's programme in Intelligent Interactive Systems (IIS) addresses both trends, focusing on the design, analysis and development of agents and robots able to interact intelligently with humans and other agents, that is, agents that can perceive, plan, act, learn and communicate.

The programme's lecturers are world-renowned scientists in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, natural language interaction and web intelligence. Students will learn about the languages, models and algorithms involved in intelligent interactive systems and will be exposed to top-level research in the field.

This is a technical master's programme, and students are expected to be familiar with mathematical language and computer science."
Brain and Cognition,Master's,"One of the greatest challenges in science is to explain the human mind. Thanks to the advent of revolutionary brain research methods, great progress in behavioural research techniques and the incredible inventiveness of many researchers, cognitive and neural sciences are finding ways to better approach this problem. The master's programme in Brain and Cognition will guide students through the latest and most exciting findings brought about by the interaction between cognitive research and brain research, furnishing them with the theoretical and practical means to actively participate in this exciting enterprise.

The core of the master's programme is composed of the research groups at UPF's Center for Brain and Cognition (CBC). These groups are directed by renowned scientists in areas such as computational neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, vision, multisensory perception, human development and comparative cognition. Students will thus be exposed to the ongoing research projects at the CBC and will be integrated in one of its main research lines, where they will conduct original research for their final project."
Computational Biomedical Engineering,Master's,"Biomedical engineering is an exciting and constantly evolving field trying to answer challenging questions in healthcare and support clinicians in their decision-making. To cope with this challenge requires progress in fields such as medicine, biology, engineering, physics, information technologies, applied mathematics, to name only a few. Biomedical engineering is the interface that integrates these fields to jointly solve a given problem, with most interesting tasks strongly involving research and innovation. 

The field of biomedical engineering offers a huge variety of interesting topics to work on, differently weighting technological, medical and biological concepts depending on the application. However, something in common in most interesting biomedical engineering projects nowadays is the relevant role of computational tools for data processing, interpretation, integration, modelling and visualization, to name a few. Examples of these computational tools include medical data analysis with classical image/signal processing or machine learning techniques, the different modelling phases involved in the development of medical devices, multi-scale computational models to simulate human organs and systems and for synthetic biology or advanced visualization techniques such as 3D printing and augmented/virtual reality interfaces, etc.; these can be used for biomarker extraction, improve diagnosis, guide minimally-invasive interventions, perform population-based statistics or give treatment recommendations in key clinical fields such as in neurology, cardiology or oncology, among others. 

This vast amount of possibilities defines the philosophy behind the CBEM MSc, empowering and giving flexibility to the student to choose and work on the research topic of her/his interest, with the academic team supporting and helping to find a student-tailored project to work during the whole year duration of the MSc."
Computer Vision,Master's,"This master's degree provides skills and expertise that can be used in many fields, allows theoretical knowledge to be quickly applied and produces multidimensional engineering professionals who can work with many systems of various applications, such as image retrieval from content, interpretation and automatic annotation of videos, extracting three-dimensional information from different views and improving the appearance of the image content.
