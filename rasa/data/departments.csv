AI&ML,AI&ML: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning group,"The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning group is one of the research groups of the Department of Information and Communication Technologies at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) in Barcelona, Spain.

The group research covers a number of areas, including:

Automated planning: is the model-based approach to intelligent behavior, where behavior is not programmed or learned, but is derived effectively from a model of the agent goals, and the way that the actions and sensors work in the world.
Interactive machine learning: is a branch of machine learning concerned with sequential decision-making problems, where the goal is designing algorithms that optimize performance during the learning procedure itself, while facing an unknown and potentially non-stationary environment.
Learning theory: is the science of analyzing machine learning problems and algorithms, with the goal of characterizing the hardness of various learning scenarios and constructing algorithms with provable performance guarantees.
Probabilistic graphical models: are graph-based representations to encode compactly probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces. Our focus is on how to efficiently answer queries (inference) and how to learn the graph structure from data (learning).
Autonomous robotics: including the development of complete software architectures as well as the creation of base methodologies and tools for new advanced features. We combine reactive behaviour and motion planning with task planning, and use reasoning mechanisms to create robotics systems for challenges like RoboCup. 
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): these problems consist of a set of variables, a domain of values than can be taken by the variables and a set of constraints specifying restrictions of the values that can be taken simultaneously by the variables. The task here is to decide whether there exist an assignment of variables to values satisfying all constraints.",Anders Jonsson

NTSA,NTSA: Nonlinear Time Series Analysis Group,"Our research is positioned at the interface between physics, applied mathematics, and neuroscience. One of our main targets is the development of innovative nonlinear time series analysis techniques. These techniques aim to characterize dynamical systems for which nonlinearities cause a complicated temporal evolution. A further main target of our work is the application of nonlinear time series techniques to electrophysiological recordings from the brain of epilepsy patients. We furthermore study coupled oscillator network models that show so-called chimera states.

The social web, the part of the web that is built around social software serving as an intermediary or as a focus for social relationships, has evolved well beyond being just a platform for trivial personal updates and wedding pictures. Social media, e-commerce, professional, political, educational, and dating sites, to mention just a few, shape our possibilities as individuals, consumers, employees, voters, students, and lovers. Our group also seeks to advance the state of the art in social computing, with a particular focus on embedding values in technology, including areas such as education, public health, and disaster response, and topics such as algorithmic fairness and crowdsourcing.
